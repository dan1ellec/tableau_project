# Tableau Project - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background


The [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers. 


## Task

To create a professional, logical, and visually appealing Tableau story for city officials looking to publicise and improve the Citi Bike program. 

The task required aggregation of the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to find two unexpected phenomena. The discovered phenomena inform 2-5 visualisations each, where these visualisations are used to create a dashboard for each phenomena. The dashboards are accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) is included. Zip code data is overlaid on the map. This is accompanied by a write-up unveiling any trends that were discovered during the analysis.


## Audience Considerations

Those reading the analysis will not be data analysts. The audience will be city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City departments. The data and analysis is therefore presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling. The visualisations are colourful enough to be included in press releases, and the analysis is thoughtful enough for dictating programmatic changes. 


## Project Focus

The project explores the use of the Citi Bike program in Jersey City, New Jersey. The program launched in Jersey City on September 21, 2015, with 350 bikes at 35 stations and has now increased to 50 stations. New Jersey data was chosen as its comparatively smaller magnitude to the New York City data means that all available records could be explored in this project. 

* The project begins with a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). The map is in two parts as it displays both the starting station frequency and the ending station frequency. 

* The project then considers the effect of COVID-19 on the program and its usership, exploring any changes that have occurred and considering possible explanations for these changes. 

* The second portion of this project will explore who uses Citi Bike and how they use the program. 

Together, these topics will combine to provide insight into current Citi Bike trends and highlight areas that need to be considered for the future of the program.

The data runs from September 2015 to March 2021. Therefore, when looking at yearly data it must be taken into consideration that 2015 and 2021 only include 3 months of data, and are therefore not suitable to include in comparative yearly trend analysis.


## Conclusion

Previously characterised by consistent Subscriber based participation, Citi Bike is now seeing an increase in casual usage by Customers (those with 24-hour or 3-day passes). 

Possible Explanations:

* Coincides with a widespread work from home initiative, so less bikes are used for the work commute. 
* 2020 saw a cycling boom, with cycling becoming an activity, a family outing or a form of exercise. 
* In a time of uncertainty and stress, the benefits of cycling on mental and physical wellbeing would have been paramount to its appeal. 
* As the cycling boom led to a bike shortage, many people who were unable to purchase their own bike, or who preferred the flexibility of a shared system, would have gravitated towards the Citi Bike program. 

Therefore, in the current climate, ensuring Citi Bike is accessible to those who use ‘Customer’ passes is crucial to the success of the program. 

Possible Actions:

* Extra advertisements about the customer passes
* The creation of cycling guides and routes that participants can follow. 
    * Could encourage longer trips that start and end near a bike station 
    * Creation of scenic tours which showcase certain areas of the city or team up with businesses. 


It will be important that while encouraging the participation of Customers, the program not neglect Subscribers. Although the number of Subscriber trips has dropped in recent times, Subscribers have still consistently been the majority of participants in previous years. Ensuring that Citi Bike remains an option for participants when they begin the process of returning to work will be important. 

A further suggestion for increasing participation will be to add additional bikes and bike stations to the system, with a focus on areas that are outside the Downtown region. Building up the resources in these areas will give many people who had previously been unable to participate in the program for practical and accessibility reasons the opportunity to take part. It may also be beneficial to implement particular outreach programs to groups in society with low participation rates. An example would be programs that encourage female ridership.
